The codes and data are for target estimation for protein/peptide drugs.

The basic principle: 
Target identification and validation is crucial during the process of drug research and development (Rï¼†D). 
Besides the disease relevance, successful drug targets generally have some common features different from other non-target proteins. 
Systematic summary of the features of successful drug targets and further computationally estimating whether a protein is proper 
to be used as a drug target (i.e. target prediction) based on these features will greatly improve efficiency and success rate of 
target selection.
These codes are used for target estimation for protein/peptide drugs.
Briefly, the target predition model was constructed by naive Bayes classifier to integrate multiple features. 




Input: input.txt, protein list represented by SP_AC, one protein per line
Output: peptide_target_estimation_score.txt for peptide drugs' target estimation
				protein_target_estimation_score.txt for protein drugs' target estimation
				
How to use:
Please install ActivePerl version 5.16 or above in your windows or Linux system

Write your interested protein list into "input.txt" file 
Run the script "target_estimation_protein.pl" for protein drugs or "target_estimation_peptide.pl" for peptide drugs
Then the target estimation scores will be given in "peptide_target_estimation_score.txt"/"protein_target_estimation_score.txt"

The target estimation score is just the "combined_LR".
In the result file, known targets for protein/peptide drugs (i.e. target proteins of FDA-approved protein/peptide drugs) 
(represented by "golden" in the file) are always given on the top, followed by other proteins with predictd "combined_LR".
